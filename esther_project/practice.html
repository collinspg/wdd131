    <h2>Esther Osaloto</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
    <p>I'm Esther Omowunmi Osaloto, and I'm a computer science student in Owutech. I live in Lagos Nigeria but originally from Kogi state. I wish to say that I am an introvert and I so much love spaghetti. I am single and I love cooking, I also hope to become a data analyst as well as a baker.</p>
    <p>My favourite quote is "If you want to change the world, you have to look at the man in the mirror and start with him". I hope to learn more from you all and hope that we all work together to meet our goals. Thank you all so much and I love you all.</p>
